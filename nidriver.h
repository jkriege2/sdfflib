/**
 * \brief This class is a hardware driver for National Instruments hardware using <b>National Instruments DAQmx 8.6</b>
 *        driver. It assumes a set of I/O cards that are accessible over the driver interface of NI-DAQmx. basically you
 *        can controll all cards that are registered with the NI Measurement & Automation Explorer.
 * \ingroup drivers
 *
 * This class may output one sequence (from a NIsequenceGenerator object) at a time. In addition it provides a convenient
 * interface for (un)synchronised analog and digital input. There are several "modes" of this class:
 *  -# in the <b>initial state</b> the class has a pool of NI-DAQmx tasks which allow for unsynchronised I/O on all
 *     channel registered with the channelManager object. These tasks will be governed internally in the \c singletasks
 *     vector. Theres is a map \c singletask_names which maps from the channel name to the vector item which contains
 *     the task for this channel. You can use the methods methods get_analog(), set_analog(), get_digital(), set_digital()
 *     to access these <b>unsynchronised tasks</b>. Some of the I/O methods of this class (sequence output, synchronised
 *     input) may take some channels out of this pool to use them for synchronised I/O. They can later be returned to this
 *     pool. Initially and after a call of reset() all channels will reside in the unsynchronised pool.
 *  -# When <b>sequence output</b> (i.e. synchronised data output) is currently done the method bind() unregisters the
 *     output channels that are needed for the sequence from the pool of unsynchronised channels. You may still use the
 *     remaining unsynchronised channels for unsynchronised I/O, as described in 1. The sequence channels will be returned
 *     to the pool by calling clear(). (for details see \ref otaskmodel_sec )
 *  -# There is a similar mechanism for <b>synchronised data input</b>. With create_input_task() you may unregister some
 *     of the pooled channels and create a NI-DAQmx task with then which may then be started. The timing of such channels
 *     is also read from \c timing.ini as described in \ref nidrivertiming_sec . But note that you may have more than one
 *     input task at a time, if your hardware device allows this. (for details see \ref itaskmodel_sec )
 * .
 *
 *
 * This class implements tha basic driver interface, defined in the SDFFLib::driver class:
 *  - reset() will perform a hardware and software reset. So thisbasically reset the object
 *    to the state directly after a call of the constructor (or any other sensefull initial state!)
 *  - bind() will bind the class to a dataset, i.e. a NIsequenceGenerator which holds the data that is
 *    output by this class. It then reserves all channels that are used in the sequence and creates NI-DAQmx tasks
 *    for them. The timing parameters for these tasks are read from the \c timing.ini file. This method calls
 *    set_output_triggering() to read the triggering information from \c timing.ini and deactivate_us_used() to
 *    unregister the channels.
 *  - start() will start the sequence output. You will first have to call bind(), as this makes the data available
 *    the object shall output. This method takes the NI-DAQmx tasks generated by bind() and starts them. It takes
 *    care that the task marked as \c last is called as the last one.
 *  - stop() will stop a sequence output. This can be used at any time after start() to stop the sequence (even
 *    mid-sequence if an error occured)
 *  - is_done() returns \c true if the object does not output a sequence and returns \c false as long as the hardware
 *    is occupied with the output. This method queries all tasks that belong to the sequence and returns true if all
 *    tasks have finished.
 * .
 * This interface can be summarized in this state diagram:\n
 *   \dotfile driver_object.dot
 *
 * To use this class first bind() the driver to a channelManager and a NIsequenceGenerator object. The lather one
 * already has to contain the generated sequence. Then you can start() the sequence and test (is_done())
 * whether the sequence reached its end. The channelManager is already provided in the constructor.
 *
 * \section otaskmodel_sec output task details and state model:
 * When there is a sequence startet, then the class unregisters the ressources of all of those unsynchronised tasks
 * so that the sequence output may be done (DAQmx driver only allows to register a ressource, i.e. a channel/pin
 * to one task at a time). This is done by the method deactivate_us_used() which is called from bind(). During the
 * output only the remaining pins may be used for I/O. After the sequence the initial state will be restored and
 * all unsynchronised tasks will be registered again (this is done by activate_us_used() ).\n
 * Each such task has a state within this class. This state is not the state of the real NI-DAQmx task (to my knowledge
 * there is no driver method to read the tasks state), but represents which methods have already been executed for this
 * task (bind(), start(), stop(), writing data ...). The state diagram for an output task is:\n
 *   \dotfile outputtaskstates.dot
 *
 *
 * \section itaskmodel_sec input tasks
 * How to generate synchronized output was described in the last section. A similar mechanism is implemented
 * for input tasks. The timing is again defined in the above timing.ini file. But there is one big difference:
 * You can have more than one synchronized input tasks at a time.
 *
 * With our hardware (PXI/PXI-6254) we have the problem that this card seems to allow only one analog input channel
 * at a time. So no task is running and we activate the needed task on demand. In synchronised input modeall
 * non-synchronised input channels are deactivated. This is implemented on a per device basis! To allow reading multiple
 * analog samples there are methods start_analog(), stop_analog() and started_read_analog().
 *
 *
 *
 * \section nidrivertiming_sec timing configuration
 * The object reads the timing configuration of the tasks from an INI file. The standard filename is \c timing.ini, but
 * you can change it with set_timing_inifile(). This file only contains few information: There has to be one
 * group for each device. Each group may contain some of these datafields:
 * \code
[device_name] | [device_name/(ao|ai|do|di)] | [device_name/port]
source = <adress string>                     # source of the trigger signal

trigger = <adress string>                    # source of the trigger signal
edge = falling | rising                      # trigger on which edge

last = false | true                          # one of the tasks where last=true will start as the last one

refclk_source = <adress string>              # source of the reference clock
refclk_rate = <rate in Hz>                   # clock rate of the reference clock

export_start_trigger = <signal name>         # export the StartTrigger on the given signal line
export_sampleclock = <signal name>           # export the SampleClock on the given signal line
export_10MHz = <signal name>                 # export the 10MHz timebase clock on the given signal line
export_20MHz = <signal name>                 # export the 20MHz timebase clock on the given signal line

sampleclock_timebase_source = <signal name>  # source of the SampleClock timebase
master_timebase_source = <signal name>       # source of the master timebase
master_timebase_rate = <rate in Hz>          # clock rate of the master timebase
   \endcode
 * There are some possibilities for the \c device_name, as you maybe want to use one configuration for
 * more than one task on one device. So you can use these possibilities as \c device_name s:
 *  -# just the name of the device (e.g. \c PXI1Slot4, \c dev1 ...). Then the data is valid for all tasks on
 *     this device besides there is a more specific definition
 *  -# \c [device_name/ao], \c [device_name/ai], \c [device_name/do], \c [device_name/di] outrank the simple
 *     \c device_name. Properties set in these groups are only valid for analog (ao, ai) or digital (do, di)
 *     input (ai, di) or output (ao, do).
 *  -# \c [device_name/port_name] this is very specific, as this sets the properties for a task with this
 *     specific port name: So if you want to set the timing for output on digital port \c port0 you
 *     will have to use this, e.g. \c [PXI1Slot4/port0]. Analog outputs are grouped by NIsequenceGenerator
 *     so for them you will have to use the complete list of analog outputs, like \c PXI1Slot4/ao0,PXI1Slot4/ao1
 * .
 * With these possibilities you can choose one (relatively specific task to provide the SampleClock, e.g. use
 * \c [dev1/ao], as there is only one analog output task per device. Set the \c last property of this group to
 * \c true, so this channel will be startet as the last one. All the other channels should then use a \c source
 * like \c dev1/ao/SampleClock which specifies the analog output sample clock (see NI-DAQmx and output card
 * documentation for available signals).
 *
 * The last property controls which task will start as the last one, so you can specify one task
 * to generate the SampleClock.
 *
 * \section tasksync_xec task synchronization
 * As mentioned above the different task have to be synchronized over the
 * different devices. In <a href="http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/3615">a NI Developer Zone article</a>
 * they describe how to synchronize multiple devices. This will be implemented in the bind() method (see there, fig.7).
 * First all devices have to share the same SampleClock. Additionally each task will be triggered by a common
 * StartTrigger signal that will be generated by the master task (i.e. the task where \c last=true).\n
 * Note that this class assumes that all your output cards are placed within one PXI chassis, so they can share
 * the same 10MHz PXI timebase (signal \c PXI_Clk10 ) for signal generation. If this is not the case for your
 * system you will have to rewrite this class and change the triggering and timing options which are beeing set
 * in the methods set_output_triggering() for triggering and  for timing.
 *
 *
 * \section nidriver_linkin_sec linking and including
 * To use the NI DAQmx 8.6 driver you need the header file \c NIDAQmx.h On a standard installation of
 * the national instruments driver this can be found in <tt>C:\\Programme\\National Instruments\\NI-DAQ\\DAQmx ANSI C Dev\\include</tt>.
 * So add the path to this file to the include directories. You also need to link against \c libnidaqmx.a which
 * has to be created from the MS VisualC++ library provided by National Instruments. You will find information
 * about how to do this in the NI forum or in the documentation to my diploma thesis and this software (\c use_nidaqmx_with_mingw.pdf):
 *  - <a href="http://forums.ni.com/ni/board/message?board.id=250&message.id=17557">http://forums.ni.com/ni/board/message?board.id=250&message.id=17557</a>
 *  - <a href="http://forums.ni.com/ni/board/message?board.id=250&message.id=10936&view=by_date_ascending&page=2">http://forums.ni.com/ni/board/message?board.id=250&message.id=10936&view=by_date_ascending&page=2</a>
 * .
 * Be aware that this driver may also work with lower NI-DAQmx versions. But you will have to generate a new
 * include library whenever installing a new driver version.
 *
 *
 * \test a test application for SDFFLib::NIdriver can be found in \link niseqout_test.cpp.
