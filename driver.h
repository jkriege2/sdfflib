/**
 * \brief virtual base class for hardware drivers. This class defines a common interface for hardware driver classes that can output a sequence
 * \ingroup drivers
 *
 * The interface consists of a set of basic methods:
 *  - reset() will perform a hardware (if possible) and software reset. So this should basically reset the object
 *    to the state directly after a call of the constructor (or any other sensefull initial state!)
 *  - bind() will bind the class to a dataset, i.e. a sequenceGenerator descendent which will hold the data that is
 *    output by this class.
 *  - start() will start the sequence output. You will first have to call bind(), as this makes the data available
 *    the object shall output.
 *  - stop() will stop a sequence output. This can be used at any time after start() to stop the sequence (even 
 *    mid-sequence if an error occured)
 *  - is_done() returns \c true if the object does not output a sequence and returns \c false as long as the hardware
 *    is occupied with the output.
 * .
 * Additionally there are two methods that return versioning information about the driver. You can use them to return
 * the version and some information about the vendor-specific hardware driver you use:
 *  - get_driver_version() returns the software version of the driver, i.e. the driver from the hardware vendor.
 *  - get_systeminfo() returns some information about the hardware system that is attatched to the computer, e.g. all
 *    available channels with their specs ... .
 * .
 *
 * This interface can be summarized in this state diagram:\n
 *   \dotfile driver_object.dot
 *
 * Every driver should also contain a method 
 * \code 
void bind(channelManager* c, NIsequenceGenerator* gen) 
 * \endcode 
 * which bind the driver to a channelManager and a sequenceGenerator. It is not possible to implement or define this 
 * function here properly, as we do not yet know the type of the argument \c gen, as a driver class may rely on 
 * using a very special sequenceGenerator descendent. So always implement your own \c bind method which may be used 
 * to load data ... by overwriting (and hiding?) the method implemented in this class.
 *
 * Any implmentation of a driver class may also add as many methods to the above interface, as needed. So have a look
 * at SDFFLib::NIdriver which also implements asynchronous I/O operations.
